The **Lithos Landing Skill** (`lithos-landing`) guides the creation and maintenance of the project's landing page at `vault/index.md`. This skill encodes the specific MDC component patterns and layout conventions used by the homepage.

## Purpose

The landing page is the first thing visitors see, and it must communicate Lithos's value proposition clearly. This skill ensures the page follows the correct layout structure, uses proper Nuxt UI page components, and maintains a consistent visual hierarchy across feature cards.

Unlike regular documentation pages, the landing page uses the `landing` layout (no sidebars) and relies heavily on MDC components like `::u-page-hero`, `:::u-page-grid`, and `::::u-page-card`. These components have specific slot and prop patterns that differ from standard Markdown content. The skill captures these patterns so agents produce valid, well-structured landing pages on every attempt.

> [!tip] Layout Awareness
> The landing layout wraps content in `<UContainer>` automatically. Do not add container wrappers in MDC — this causes double-padding and layout overflow issues.

## Key Conventions

### Card Grid Pattern

Feature cards use a 3-column responsive grid with cards spanning 1 or 2 columns. Wide cards (2 columns) include images via `::u-color-mode-image`, while narrow cards (1 column) use icons. This alternating pattern creates visual rhythm and breaks up the page into scannable sections.

Each card links to an internal feature or guide page. Cards should cover the core capabilities of Lithos: [[Obsidian Native]] syntax, [[Interactive Graph]], [[Structured Data]], [[MCP Server]], static generation, and [[Daily Notes]]. The selection should balance Obsidian-originated features with Docus/Nuxt-powered capabilities.

> [!note] Image Sources
> Use real images from `obsidian.md` and `docus.dev` for feature illustrations. Both sites provide light and dark mode variants that work with `::u-color-mode-image`.

### Integration with Skills

This skill works alongside the [[Lithos Documentation Skill]] for general conventions and the [[Lithos Feature Skill]] for the feature pages that cards link to. When modifying the landing page, verify that all `to:` links point to existing pages in the vault.
