The **Obsidian Bases Skill** (`obsidian-bases`) defines how to create and manage structured databases within Lithos.

> [!note] Reference
> This skill powers the [[Obsidian Bases]] feature documentation.

## Purpose

Enables the creation of complex filtered views (Tables, Cards, Lists) directly from Obsidian properties.

## Configuration

Bases are defined using `.base` files or inline code blocks.

### Example Base Definition

```yaml
title: My Project Base
source: Projects/
views:
  - type: table
    name: All Projects
  - type: cards
    name: Active Cards
    image: cover
```

## Agent Instructions

When asking the agent to create a base:

1.  **Specify Source**: Which folder to look in?
2.  **Define Columns**: What frontmatter properties to show?
3.  **Choose View**: Table, Cards, or List?

The agent will use this skill to generate the appropriate `.base` file or MDC component.
