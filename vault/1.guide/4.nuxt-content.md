Lithos is built on [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com) and [Docus](https://docus.dev). Your primary authoring syntax is always Obsidian (see [[Writing Content]]). MDC (Markdown Components) syntax is available for features that have **no Obsidian equivalent** -- interactive tabs, landing page grids, code groups, and other web-specific components.

> [!note] When to use MDC
> Use MDC only when Obsidian syntax does not cover what you need. For example, the landing page uses `::u-page-hero` and `::u-page-card` components because Obsidian has no concept of hero sections or card grids. For everything else -- links, embeds, callouts, math, diagrams -- use standard Obsidian syntax.

## MDC Syntax Basics

MDC allows you to use Vue components directly in your Markdown.

### Attributes and Props

You can pass props to components using `{}` syntax:
- String: `key="value"`
- Number: `key=123`
- Boolean: `key` (implies true) or `:key="false"`
- Array/Object: `:key="[1, 2]"`

```markdown
::alert{type="info" :dismissible="true"}
This is an info alert.
::
```

### Slots

Components can have named slots invoked with `#slot-name`.

```markdown
::card
#title
My Card Title

#default
This is the main content of the card.

#footer
Optional footer content.
::
```

## Built-in Components

Lithos inherits Docus's rich component library.

### Alert / Callout

::alert{type="info"}
This is a standard Docus alert component.
::

### Badge

::badge{type="warning" size="md"}
v1.0.0
::

### Code Groups

Display multiple code blocks in a tabbed interface:

::code-group
  ```bash [npm]
  npm install lithos
  ```

  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn add lithos
  ```
::

### Steps

Great for tutorials or workflows:

::steps
  1. **Install**
     Run the installation command.
  2. **Configure**
     Update `nuxt.config.ts`.
  3. **Deploy**
     Push to production.

## Layout Slots

You can insert content into specific layout slots using the `::` syntax.

### Page Hero (`::block-hero`)

Overrides the header area of the page.

::block-hero
---
title: Custom Hero
description: This hero overrides the default page title.
---
#actions
[Get Started](/guide/getting-started)
::

### Card Grid (`::card-grid`)

Creates a responsive grid for keys features or navigation.

::card-grid
#title
Features

#root
  ::card
  ---
  title: Feature A
  icon: i-lucide-star
  ---
  Description of feature A.
  ::
  
  ::card
  ---
  title: Feature B
  icon: i-lucide-zap
  ---
  Description of feature B.
  ::
::

## Frontmatter

Lithos supports both Obsidian-style YAML frontmatter and Nuxt Content's extended frontmatter.

```yaml
---
title: My Page
description: Page description
icon: i-lucide-home
navigation:
  title: Sidebar Title
head:
  meta:
    - name: 'keywords'
      content: 'nuxt, obsidian, docs'
---
```

## Mixing with Obsidian

You can use MDC components *inside* Obsidian callouts, or Obsidian links *inside* MDC components.

> [!example] Hybrid Example
> ::badge{type="success"}
> Hybrid
> ::
> This text contains a [[Wikilink]] inside a hybrid structure.
