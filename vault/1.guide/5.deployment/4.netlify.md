Netlify offers one-click deploys, automatic HTTPS, form handling, and edge functions. Excellent for documentation sites that need advanced features or scale beyond GitHub Pages' limits.

## Netlify Configuration

Create `netlify.toml` in your project root:

```toml
[build]
  publish = ".output/public"
  command = "npm run generate"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
  force = false

[[headers]]
  for = "/_nuxt/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "text/javascript; charset=utf-8"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.css"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "text/css; charset=utf-8"
```

## Deployment Methods

### Git Integration

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up
2. Click **New site from Git**
3. Authorize and select your repository
4. Netlify auto-detects Nuxt and suggests settings
5. Click **Deploy site**

Deploys trigger automatically when you push to your connected branch.

### CLI Deployment

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy (creates a new site)
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Manual Deploy

1. Run `npm run generate` locally
2. Go to Netlify dashboard
3. Drag and drop `.output/public` folder to deploy

## Environment Variables

Set in **Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment**:

```
NUXT_APP_BASE_URL=/
NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://docs.example.com
```

Or in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build.environment]
  NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL = "https://docs.example.com"
```

## Custom Domain

1. Go to **Domain settings**
2. Click **Add custom domain**
3. Configure DNS:
   - Option A: Use Netlify DNS (recommended)
   - Option B: Add CNAME pointing to `*.netlify.app`

Netlify automatically provisions and renews SSL certificates.

## Advanced Features

### Deploy Previews

Every pull request gets a unique preview URL. Share with collaborators to review changes before merging.

Enable in **Site settings > Build & deploy > Deploy contexts**.

### Branch Deploys

Deploy multiple branches to different URLs:

```toml
[context.staging]
  command = "npm run generate"
  
[context.staging.environment]
  NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL = "https://staging.docs.example.com"
```

### Form Handling

Add Netlify's form handling without backend code:

```html
<form name="feedback" method="POST" data-netlify="true">
  <input type="text" name="name" />
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

Submissions appear in **Forms** in your Netlify dashboard.

### Edge Functions

Run server-side logic at the CDN edge:

```typescript
// netlify/edge-functions/hello.ts
export default async () => {
  return new Response("Hello from the edge!")
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

Check **Deploys** for detailed logs. Common issues:

- Node version mismatch (set in `netlify.toml`)
- Missing dependencies (run `npm ci` not `npm install`)
- Environment variables not set

### Slow Builds

Enable build caching in **Site settings > Build & deploy > Build settings**:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run generate"
  
[build.processing]
  skip_processing = false
```

### SPA Routing Issues

Ensure the redirect rule is present:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
  force = false
```
